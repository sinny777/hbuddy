				<h2>The Coolest Features of Home Automation Systems</h2>

			        <h3>Lighting Switches On and Off Automatically</h3>
			        <p view-description>Lighting systems can be programmed to switch certain lights on or off automatically. This means that lights can be set to switch off or dim in certain lighting
			        conditions (for example where natural light is adequate), reducing lighting costs. Alternatively, lights can be set to switch on automatically when one enters a
			        room or a dark stairwell, making the home safer and eliminating the need to fumble for light switches. In addition, lighting can be set to be dimmer or brighter,
			        with certain lights being brighter than others, to create specific moods. For example, one can pre-program settings for romantic evenings in, dinner parties, or
			        normal evenings at home with the family.</p>

			        <h3>The House Can Let You Know How It Is</h3>
			        <p>Home automation systems allow one to monitor conditions in the home from a remote location, provided the subsystems are connected to one's home internet network.
			        In fact, some systems can alert one to events via text, email, or social media applications like Twitter. Certain security systems can be set to email photos of
			        visitors to the homeowner when the system is armed, and some communication systems can let one know if the fridge breaks down while one is on holiday.
			        The latter type of system has integrated temperature, moisture, and vibration sensors that activate automated messages if certain criteria are met.
			        For example, if the moisture sensor in the basement gets wet, the device can text homeowners to let them know that the area has flooded.</p>

			        <h3>Intelligent Climate Control</h3>
			        <p>Heating and air conditioning systems can be set to certain levels based on expected and actual occupancy, the weather forecast, or the inside temperature. These
			        systems can also be controlled remotely, and can be programmed to switch off if a window or exterior door is left open. Again, this is a great savings mechanism,
			        reducing the amount of electricity wasted on unnecessary cooling or heating. It also ensures that the house is at the right temperature at all times, and will eliminate
			        scenarios where one walks into a boiling hot or freezing cold house after being out and misjudging the weather.</p>

			        <h3> Security Systems are More Secure</h3>
			        <p>Automated home security systems tend to offer a wider range of features than their predecessors. Systems respond to voice and biometric data, and locks can be
			        upgraded to keypads that are opened with codes or swipe cards. These systems can be turned on or off via remote control, email, or phone, and camera feeds can be
			        sent directly to one's computer. Audible alarms can be used to alert one of intruders, while silent alarms can be used to alert the authorities. That awful feeling
			        of uncertainty that some people feel about having locked all the doors when leaving the house can be eliminated. One can simply lock the offending door remotely and
			        carry on without giving it a second thought.</p>

			        <h3>Systems are Designed to Work Together</h3>
			        <p>Home automation systems are designed with the integration of subsystems in mind, allowing one to tie electronic devices together to perform as a unified system.
			        For example, one can have the lights turn off and the thermostats set lower when a motion sensor is triggered as you leave a room. Once again, this ties in with
			        energy and cost savings and environmental responsibility. Lights and heaters or air conditioning will not be left on unnecessarily.</p>

			        <h3>Remote Access</h3>
			        <p>Probably one of the coolest features of home automation systems, remote access allows one to control one's home environment from a remote location. One can change
			        settings from the office or while on holiday, or during the commute on the way home from the office. Should one's plans for the day or evening change, one can simply
			        update the settings for the home automation system to avoid unnecessary energy use. One can also monitor the home environment while away, or tweak settings without
			        having to ask someone to go in to make adjustments. This is especially useful when sudden snow or cold can make pipes freeze and thermostats need to be set higher.</p>
