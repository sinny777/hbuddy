                  <p view-description>To Make Your Event "The Most Special Moments of Your Life" {{pageContent.siteName}} is established with an intention to create virtual presence at event locations of people, who are not be able to attend important events in their families.</p>
                  
                  <p>It has become very common that many of our family members are unable to attend some important functions in the family. In this era of globalization, people have settled in different places far away from each other. And the wedding-couples whom we have met felt unhappy that some of their close friends and well wishers could not make it to the wedding. And it is also not very uncommon for the bride and the bridegroom to edit the long list of their work colleagues for the final invitation.</p>
                  
                  <blockquote><p>At {{pageContent.siteName}} we intend to solve simple problems concerning human emotions through technology.</p></blockquote>

				<h2><span>Our Ethics</span></h2>

Our shared commitment to GRANSLIVE operating as an ethical business strengthens us and what we offer to our clients.</p>
                  
                  <blockquote><p>By acting in accordance with these values, we earn the respect of, and show respect for, our clients and colleagues, Our ethics and values are put into practice through the {{pageContent.siteName}} Code of Conduct which sets out the principles and rules of conduct that guide our people in high professional and ethical standards required of them. The code is supported by a network of ethics advisers who are available to assist employees in dealing with ethical and professional concerns.</p></blockquote>
                  
                <h2><span>Our Core Values</span></h2>
                  <p><strong>Integrity</strong>, which requires us to be honest and impartial in our dealings with others.</p>
