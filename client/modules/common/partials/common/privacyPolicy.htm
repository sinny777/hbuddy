		<p>Last Updated: April 16, 2015</p>
		<p>
			GransLive, (<strong><em>"GransLive"</em></strong>, <strong><em>"we"</em></strong>
			or <strong><em>"us"</em></strong>) provides this Privacy Policy to
			inform you of our policies and procedures regarding the personal
			information we receive from users like you when you use our Services
			(defined in the <a href="/#!/terms" target="_blank">Terms of Service</a>),
			whether on our websites, embeddable video players, the GransLive
			channels, or our software and mobile applications.
		</p>
		<p>As used in this policy, the terms "using" and "processing"
			information include using cookies on a computer, subjecting the
			information to statistical or other analysis and using or touching
			information in any way, including, but not limited to collecting,
			storing, evaluating, modifying, deleting, using, combining,
			disclosing and transferring information within the United States or
			internationally.</p>
		<h3>Information Collection and Use</h3>
		<p>Our primary goals in collecting information are to provide and
			improve our Services, features and content, to administer your
			membership and to enable users to enjoy and easily navigate the Site.
			We also may also use your information in order to better understand
			how our Services are used.</p>
		<p>
			<u>Personally Identifiable Information.</u>
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>In the course of using the Services, we ask you to provide
				us with certain personally identifiable information that can be used
				to contact or identify you and administer your account (<strong><em>"Personal
						Information"</em></strong>). Personal Information may include, but is not
				limited to, your name, phone number, credit card or other billing
				information, email address and home and business postal addresses.
				We use your Personal Information mainly to provide the Services and
				administer your inquiries.
			</li>
			<li>Please be aware that when you register to become a GransLive
				Member, other users of the Services may be able to see your screen
				or user name, in addition to any comments or submissions that you
				post to the Site or submit via the Services. We recommend that you
				guard your anonymity and sensitive information and that you not use
				your real name as your screen or user name to the extent that allows
				others to identify you. If your use of the Services violates or
				potentially violates <a href="/#!/acceptableusepolicy">GransLive's
					Acceptable Use Policy</a>, your Personal Information may be shared with
				law enforcement and other third parties in accordance with this
				Privacy Policy and subject to all applicable laws.
			</li>
			<li>We also collect other information that you provide as part
				of your use of the Services, including via your registration and the
				administration and personalization of your profile webpage (e.g.,
				without limitation zip code, gender, age and individual preferences)
				(<strong><em>"Non-Identifying Information"</em></strong>). Certain
				Non-Identifying Information would be considered a part of your
				Personal Information if it were combined with other identifiers (for
				example, combining your zip code with your street address) in a way
				that enables you to be identified. But the same pieces of
				information are considered Non-Identifying Information when they are
				taken alone or combined only with other non-identifying information
				(for example, your viewing preferences). We may combine your
				Personal Information with Non-Identifying Information and aggregate
				it with information collected from other GransLive Users to attempt to
				provide you with a better experience, to improve the quality and
				value of the Services and to analyze and understand how our Services
				are used.
			</li>
			<li>We also use your Personal Information to contact you with
				GransLive newsletters, marketing or promotional materials and other
				information that may be of interest to you. GransLive Members who
				agree to the terms and conditions of the GransLive Terms of Service
				Agreement are given the opportunity to opt-in to receiving such
				communications from us in the future. If you decide at any time that
				you no longer wish to receive such communications from us, please
				follow the unsubscribe instructions provided in any of the
				communications or update your "user preferences" information. (See <strong><em>"Changing
						or Deleting Information,"</em></strong> below.)
			</li>
			<li>GransLive will also share and use your Personal Information
				with GransLive Asia, and other networks, websites and entities
				affiliated, owned, controlled and/or connected with GransLive. We will
				use your Personal Information in compliance with the terms of this
				Privacy Policy.</li>
			<li>At times, we may offer special access to pay-per-view or
				other special promotional events (e.g., live broadcast of concerts),
				and we may share your Personal Information with those entities and
				advertisers that are participating in such event. Unless otherwise
				stated, we will only share your name and email address to such
				parties, so you may receive newsletters or promotional materials
				from such entities.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			<u>Surveys and Promotions.</u> From time to time, we may provide you
			with the opportunity to participate in surveys, contests or
			sweepstakes (any of these a <strong><em>"Promotion"</em></strong>)
			via our Services. If you participate in a Promotion we will request
			certain Personal Information from you. We use the Personal
			Information you provide to us in these instances to administer your
			participation in the Promotion. Participation in a Promotion is
			completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not
			to disclose this information.
		</p>
		<p>
			<u>Log Data.</u> As you use the Services, whether as a GransLive Member
			or a non-registered user just browsing (any of these, a <strong><em>"GransLive
					User"</em></strong>), our servers automatically record information that your
			browser sends whenever you visit a website or information that your
			mobile device sends when you launch and use the mobile app (<strong><em>"Log
					Data"</em></strong>). This log data may include information such as your
			computer’s IP address, browser type or the domain from which you are
			visiting or information from your mobile device like screen
			resolution, device model, carrier and operating system version. We
			use this information to monitor and analyze use of the Services and
			for the Site's technical administration. We do not treat Log Data as
			Personal Information or use it in association with other Personal
			Information, though we may aggregate, analyze and evaluate such
			information for the same purposes as stated above regarding other
			Non-Identifying Information.
		</p>
		<p>
			<u>Do Not Track.</u> At this time, there is no formal standard for
			"do not track" signals and responses. As a result, GransLive does not
			assign any meaning to potential "do not track" signals. GransLive may
			receive personally identifiable information about your activity on
			third party websites in certain circumstances, e.g., if you connect
			your GransLive account to a social networking service (as described
			below). Other parties may collect personally identifiable information
			about your online activities and across third party websites or
			services when you use the GransLive website or service.
		</p>
		<h3>Cookies</h3>

			information our use of cookies, please see our <a
				href="/#!/cookiepolicy" target="_blank">Cookie Policy.</a>

			<u>GransLive Members.</u> When you register through the Site and submit
			your Personal Information to create a profile webpage, GransLive Users
			will see your screen or user name and the month and year you first
			registered with GransLive (<strong><em>"Required Member
					Identifiers"</em></strong>). You can choose what other Personal Information you
			provide as part of your profile (<strong><em>"Other
					Member Information"</em></strong>) and in some cases you can choose whether to
			share that information publicly on the Site by making selections via
			the "user preferences" section of your profile webpage. Providing
			Other Member Information is voluntary and should correlate with the
			degree of interaction you want to have with GransLive Users. We
			recommend that you guard your anonymity and sensitive information.
		</p>
		<p>
			<u>Aggregate Information and Non-Identifying Information.</u> We may
			share aggregated information that includes certain portions of your
			Non-Identifying Information and Log Data with third parties for
			industry analysis and demographic profiling and to deliver targeted
			advertising about other products and services.
		</p>
		<p>
			<u>Service Providers.</u> We may employ third party companies and
			individuals to facilitate our Services, to provide the Services on
			our behalf, to perform related services or to assist us in analyzing
			how our Services are used (each a <strong><em>"Service
					Provider"</em></strong>). The types of Service Providers we use include, without
			limitation, those that provide the following types of services:
			credit card processing, accounting, customer relationship management,
			website maintenance, notification services, database management and
			analytics. These third parties have access to your Personal
			Information only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are
			obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.
		</p>
		<p>

		<p>
			<u>Third Party Advertising Companies.</u> We may use third-party
			advertising companies to serve ads on the Site and through the
			Services. These companies may use information about your visits to
			the Site and other websites in order to provide advertisements about
			goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more
			information about this practice and to know your choices about not
			having this information used by these companies, please visit <a

			and <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.com" target="_blank">www.youronlinechoices.com</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			<u>Third Party Social Networking Services.</u> As a GransLive Member
			you can link your account information with certain social networking
			services ("SNSs") and broadcast your activities and other data to
			your friends. In these instances, depending on the "user preferences"
			you set in your GransLive account, with your permission and on your
			behalf we will share the information contained in your GransLive
			account (e.g., GransLive profile page, channel page and any other
			information you deem public in any content you create on the Site)
			with the SNS. We also receive certain information (which may include
			your Personal Information) in accordance with the privacy settings
			you have set in your SNS account, if any. Other than what we may
			share with the SNS in connection with your linking of accounts, the
			personal information a SNS has about you is obtained by the SNS
			independent of our Services. Other services follow different rules
			regarding the use or disclosure of the personal information you
			submit to them. We encourage you to read the privacy policies or
			statements of the other online services you use.
		</p>
		<p>
			<u>Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement.</u> GransLive cooperates
			with government and law enforcement officials or private parties to
			enforce and comply with the law. We will disclose any information
			about you to government or law enforcement officials or private
			parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or
			appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including but not
			limited to subpoenas), to protect the property and rights of GransLive
			or a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person,
			or to prevent or stop any illegal, unethical or legally actionable
			activity.
		</p>
		<p>
			<u>Business Transfers.</u> GransLive may sell, transfer or otherwise
			share some or all of its assets, including your Personal Information,
			in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of
			assets or in the event of bankruptcy. If GransLive becomes involved in
			a merger, acquisition, reorganization or any form of sale of some or
			all of its assets, we will provide notice to you before your Personal
			Information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy
			policy.
		</p>
		<h3>Changing or Deleting Your Information</h3>
		<p>All GransLive Members may review, update, correct or delete the
			Personal Information in their registration profile by contacting us.

		<h3>Security</h3>
		<p>GransLive is very concerned with safeguarding your information.
			We employ reasonable physical, technological, and administrative
			security measures and attempt to ensure they are applicable under the
			circumstances. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method
			of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we
			strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal
			information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
		<p>We will make any legally required disclosures of any breach of
			the security, confidentiality or integrity of your unencrypted
			electronically stored Personal Data (as defined in applicable state
			statutes on security breach notification) to you via email or
			conspicuous posting on this Site in the most expedient time possible
			and without unreasonable delay, insofar as consistent with (i) the
			legitimate needs of law enforcement or (ii) any measures necessary to
			determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable
			integrity of the data system.</p>
		<h3>International Transfer</h3>
		<p>Your information may be transferred to and maintained on
			computers located outside of your state, province, country or other
			governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as
			protective as those in your jurisdiction. Your submission of such information represents your agreement
			to that transfer.</p>
		<h3>Links to Other Sites</h3>
		<p>The Services contain links to other websites. If you choose to
			visit an advertiser by "clicking on" a banner ad or other type of
			advertisement, or click on another third-party link, you will be
			directed to that third party's website. The fact that we link to a
			website or present a banner ad or other type of advertisement is not
			an endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation
			with that third party, nor is it an endorsement of their privacy or
			information security policies or practices. We do not exercise
			control over third party websites. These other websites may place
			their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or
			solicit personal information from you. This Privacy Policy addresses
			the use and disclosure of information that we collect from you
			through our Services. Other sites follow different rules regarding
			the use or disclosure of the personal information you submit to them.
			We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of the
			other websites you visit.</p>
