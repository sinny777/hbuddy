			<strong>Harness the capabilities of Service-Oriented Architecture to achieve accelerated growth.</strong><br /><br />
			In the midst of rapidly changing market conditions, fierce competition and evolving customer expectations, IT professionals face the constant challenge to create more resilient IT infrastructures to reduce the complexity of application and IT environments and leverage them for accelerated growth. Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) addresses these challenges by developing service-oriented applications that can be easily deployed on any middleware platform and integrated with new or legacy applications.<br /><br />

			Big data makes it possible to ingest and analyze massive amounts of data in real-time through cloud-based distributed computing methods. Businesses can leverage new capabilities for timely insights with big data that strengthen business performance and create a market advantage.<br /><br />
			Now that it’s possible to predict what will likely happen in the next day, hour, or second, big data insights change the landscape of possibilities. From optimizing marketing campaigns to improving logistics with machine-to-machine data, there are opportunities for every industry to optimize business processes and increase revenue with data. While the opportunities are exciting, it can be overwhelming for most organizations to make sense of it all.<br /><br />
			More and more sources of information are being fed into the analysis, resulting in an explosion in volumes of data being generated. Companies are already experiencing significant data growth, resulting in intolerable data storage costs. Spending more on data storage is directly eroding the company’s bottom line, which is unacceptable for any business looking to grow into the future. Maven Wave has solutions to help you take advantage of big data opportunities while controlling the costs associated with storing and managing vast amounts of data.
